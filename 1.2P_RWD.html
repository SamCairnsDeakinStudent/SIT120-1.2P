            <h1>What is Responsive Web Design and Why is it Important?</h1>
            <p>
                Responsive Web Design is a web design approach that utilises HTML and CSS techniques to create 
                web pages that automictically scale content to the resolution and size of any device that the page is being viewed on.

                With the rise of smart devices that can access the World Wide Web, 
                web designers have learnt to accommodate for the almost infinite variety of screen resolutions, 
                aspect ratios and physical sizes of smartphones, TV displays and PC monitors.

                Responsive Web Design ensures that all content can be comfortably viewed and used. 
                Without the implementation of responsive web design, pages cannot comfortably scale to the size of a display. 
                For example, a web page made to fit a smartphone not utilising a responsive web design approach doesnâ€™t 
                scale well to a large PC monitor as the width and resolution of the display will have changed causing content such as, 
                text and images to scale across the width of the screen throwing out all the carefully curated usability.
